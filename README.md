# Delaunay triangulation on GPU
a shader implementation of delaunay triangulation

## Graphics Algorithms Collection

This repository contains a set of tools for graphical computations and visualizations, specifically focusing on triangulation and Voronoi diagrams. These tools are designed for use with Max/MSP Jitter, a visual programming language for music and multimedia.

## Files Description

1. **delaunay.jxs**
   - **Type**: Jitter Shader
   - **Description**: This shader is intended for Delaunay triangulation, a method for creating a mesh of triangles from a given set of points. It's useful in various computer graphics applications.

2. **fastVoronoi.jxs**
   - **Type**: Jitter Shader
   - **Description**: This shader implements a fast Voronoi diagram algorithm. Voronoi diagrams are used for partitioning a plane based on distances to a set of points, finding applications in graphics, geospatial mapping, and more.

3. **triangulation.maxpat**
   - **Type**: Max Patch
   - **Description**: This Max patch likely utilizes the shaders provided in the other files for performing triangulation tasks. It's a visual program that showcases the application of the Delaunay and Voronoi algorithms in a practical setting.

## Usage

To use these shaders and the patch, you should have Max/MSP Jitter installed on your computer. Load the shaders into your Jitter projects to apply the Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi algorithms. The Max patch can be opened directly in Max/MSP for an interactive experience with these algorithms.

## Requirements

- Max/MSP Jitter

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. Please ensure that any enhancements or bug fixes are compatible with the latest version of Max/MSP Jitter.
